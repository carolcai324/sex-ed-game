      <h2>Background Information</h2>
      <p>Each year in the United States, about 750,000 teens become pregnant, with up to 82% of them unintended. More than half of these young mothers never get to finish high school; the implication of their unintended pregnancies are extremely burdensome in their adult life. Furthermore, teenagers account for 25% of all new HIV infections in the US and make up almost half of the over 19 million new STD infections each year. In certain countries, teenage pregnancies account for nearly 10% of all pregnancies, which has a negative impact on the nation’s society and culture. The lack of uniform sex education programs and curricula in schools should account for all this misfortune that befall teenagers.</p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="ourGoals">
      <h2>Our Goals</h2>
      <p>To make up for the currently ineffective and even non-existent sex education in school curricula, our team decides to create a game to give sex education to teenagers from all over the world.After creating several different versions of game’s prototype and conducting evaluation through testing, we are ready to launch our finalized game SExploration in all English-speaking countries. In the future, we will continue to evaluate the game, update the information, and improve the game. We are also planning to translate the game into different languages and adjust certain content to fit the demands of different markets. We aim to reduce STD contractions, unintended teenage pregnancy rates, as well as encouraging better communications among teengagers. We believe that these actions will create a positive impact on the world’s economy, population’s health, as well as the wellbeing of the future generations to come. </p> <br>

      <p> My name is Audrey Chen. I am interested in entrepreneurship and marketing, focuses on the business management of the company.
